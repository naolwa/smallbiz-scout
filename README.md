# 🌍 SDG 8: AI Business Insight Module

### *Helping Small Businesses Make Data-Driven Decisions for Growth and Decent Work*

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project supports **UN Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)** by using **unsupervised learning** to help **small businesses** understand their data, discover performance patterns, and make better decisions.

By clustering businesses based on performance metrics and forecasting trends, the module helps identify which businesses need support to grow, reduce risk, and increase profitability.

---

## 🎯 Goal

> **Cluster businesses to find groups that need support to grow and create decent jobs.**

## 🗂️ Dataset

Use any **open-source dataset** such as:

* [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)
* [UN SDG Database](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) — e.g., “SME Growth Dataset”, “Employment and Productivity Data”

Save your dataset as:

```
data.csv
```

Example columns:

| employment_rate | productivity | revenue | firm_size |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------- | --------- |

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1️⃣ Load the Data

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df.head()
```

### 2️⃣ Check the Data

```python
df.info()
df.describe()
```

### 3️⃣ Clean Missing Values

```python
df = df.dropna(thresh=int(0.7*len(df.columns)))
df = df.fillna(df.median())
```

### 4️⃣ Select Features

```python
features = ['employment_rate','productivity','revenue','firm_size']
X = df[features]
```

### 5️⃣ Scale the Data

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

### 6️⃣ Apply K-Means Clustering

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
```

### 7️⃣ Visualize Clusters

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
comp = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
plt.scatter(comp[:,0], comp[:,1], c=df['cluster'])
plt.title('Clusters (PCA Projection)')
plt.show()
```

### 8️⃣ Evaluate Cluster Quality

```python
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
score = silhouette_score(X_scaled, df['cluster'])
print("Silhouette Score:", round(score,3))
```

### 9️⃣ Interpret Results

```python
df.groupby('cluster')[features].mean()
```

* **Cluster 0:** High productivity and employment — healthy businesses.
* **Cluster 1:** Moderate revenue — stable but needs optimization.
* **Cluster 2:** Low revenue and small firms — require growth support.

## 🌱 Ethical Reflection

* Data may underrepresent small or informal businesses, introducing bias.
* Clusters should guide — not dictate — decisions.
* Encourage transparency and stakeholder feedback before implementing strategies.

---

## 📊 Deliverables

* Cleaned dataset (`data.csv`)
* Jupyter Notebook with analysis
* Visualizations (PCA + cluster means)
* Short ethical reflection
* [📄 Final Report (PDF)](sandbox:/mnt/data/SDG8_UnsupervisedLearning_Report.pdf)

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add **forecasting** (Linear Regression or LSTM) to predict future sales/profit.
* Integrate a **Streamlit dashboard** for user-friendly interaction.
* Include **risk detection** for early warning on declining performance.
